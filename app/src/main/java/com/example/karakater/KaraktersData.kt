        "Reimu Hakurei's personality is typified by her desires, such as the desire to be wanted, to have good food, and to find happiness. Her biggest internal conflict comes from balancing her duties as the Hakurei shrine maiden and her own desires, though she does not seem to prefer acknowledging many of her internal conflicts.\n" +
                "Her duty as the shrine maiden gives Reimu a sense of purpose and identity, however, it conflicts with her desires in that it distances her from others and has her dealing with incidents and other related problems on a frequent basis. Despite her duty making it seem as though she antagonizes youkai, in truth, she wishes for peace between humans and youkai.",
        "Outwardly, Marisa is an outgoing and informal individual. She socializes with many inhabitants of Gensokyo and is friendly to both human and non-humans individuals, although still remaining wary around youkai. She's quick to act if she hears or sees anything interesting; sometimes doing dangerous things to satiate her interest at the time. An example is when she follows an eagle on a whim in the middle of a blizzard.[6] She speaks in an informal manner and typically uses the sentence ending particle ze (ぜ). \"Ze\" used at the end of verb stems delivers a \"boyish\" and \"impolite\" sound to the listener/reader. Ze is mostly used in a context to express one's will to act (similar to \"let's\" in English), and using it in other cases sound somewhat unnatural, perhaps \"phony\" or \"showy\".\n" +
                "In the past, Marisa was known to be a habitual liar. Such as when she claimed to be Reimu Hakurei to avoid being troubled by Flandre Scarlet [7] or when she blamed various crimes to Alice Margatroid to get Reimu out of the way.[8] However, she puts no effort into actually deceiving anyone as her lies are extremely obvious. Over time, this tendency to lie has decreased and she's more likely to tell the truth to others. By the time of Wily Beast and Weakest Creature, she willingly tells Saki Kurokoma to come to her place and emphasises that it is not the shrine.[9] Although that could be because she was possessed by the proud Eagle spirit.",
        "Sakuya Izayoi (十六夜　咲夜 Izayoi Sakuya) is the Chief Maid who serves Remilia Scarlet, the head of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She is the only human living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion\n" +
                "Sakuya tends to be a little spacey, but it's unknown if its just an act. She's polite and pleasant towards to her mistress Remilia Scarlet and those she's close with, such as Patchouli Knowledge, while being less formal with other people. With those she's frequently annoyed with, such as Marisa Kirisame, she can be somewhat harsh and direct with her insults and smack-talk, especially during duels. She seems to possess a wry wit and delivers comebacks stoically.",
        "Youmu Konpaku (魂魄　妖夢 Konpaku Youmu) is a half-human half-phantom who lives at Hakugyokurou in the Netherworld as a gardener and swordplay instructor, who also serves for Yuyuko Saigyouji. She first appeared as the Stage 5 boss of Perfect Cherry Blossom, the seventh installment of the Touhou Project, and has since become a recurring playable character.\n" +
                "As she has a straightforward diligent personality, she is often manipulated by those around her (especially Yuyuko).[3][4] For this reason, she often fails at her task, but that does not mean that she has no real power, and she particularly excels at instantaneous force and concentration power.[5] In Immaterial and Missing Power, as literally stated by the shishou, \"truth-slashing is something which you know\", so she often performs tsujigiri-like moves, but Suika Ibuki pointed out that she does not think that Youmu understood her shishou's teachings.",
        "Reisen Udongein Inaba (鈴仙・優曇華院・イナバ) is one of the moon rabbits who fled from the Moon to Earth as a refugee from the \"Lunar War\" between the two worlds that began in 1969 A.D. after the Apollo 11 \"invasion\". Making her way to Gensokyo, she was surprised to meet the notorious fugitives Kaguya Houraisan and Eirin Yagokoro, and asked for asylum in Eientei. In exchange, she works for and protects Kaguya and Eirin.\n" +
                "Despite her insanity-inducing abilities, she is actually a rather balanced and thoughtful individual. She has a high level of generalized anxiety, and appears to be constantly afraid of being punished by her superiors, as seen in her bad ending of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. This may be due to her history of being slave in the Lunar Capital and a contributing factor to why she fled in the first place. Despite her relative degree of freedom while living at Eientei in Gensokyo, she still desires to make herself useful to others as much as possible, even at personal expense.",
        "Sanae Kochiya (東風谷　早苗 Kochiya Sanae) is a human, but is also a distant descendant of the goddess Suwako Moriya. Her role at the Moriya Shrine is similar to a shrine maiden, but with her inherited power Sanae has also become a minor deity herself. Originally from the Outside World, Sanae migrated to Gensokyo with the shrine and its two resident goddesses, Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya. As a result, she is rather knowledgeable about the outside world and modern living, although her attempts to explain scientific concepts usually just confuse the locals. Her knowledge on things like the youkai of Gensokyo, on the other hand, seems a bit lacking for a shrine maiden.\n" +
                "Sanae is confident, energetic and dutiful, sometimes too much so, and tends to get carried away easily or have trouble thinking for herself. She also appears to be something of a geek, making references to popular culture and having knowledge of advanced scientific concepts. As someone who grew up in the Outside World, much of Gensokyo seems strange and novel to her; she finds great fun in \"exterminating\" youkai and solving incidents. She also may have somewhat of a complex about herself as an incident resolver, thinking foes won't take her as seriously as the other experienced youkai exterminators. The simple fact that she is adjusting to life in Gensokyo makes her an extremely rare case.",
        "Alice Margatroid (アリス・マーガトロイド Arisu Māgatoroido) is a doll-controlling magician who lives in her home in the Forest of Magic near the home of Marisa Kirisame. According to ZUN's comments in the Music Room of Perfect Cherry Blossom, Alice is kind of a special character in the Touhou Project.\n" +
                "According to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, maybe since she was originally a human, even as a youkai, she has high understanding and friendship level to humans and presents a low danger level, and if someone gets lost in the Forest of Magic, she also gladly gives shelter upon arriving at her house. However, Alice's house is covered all over with dolls, and since she is not very eager for conversation, it seems like visitors immediately flee when there is something eerie.[1][2] When she showed her hospitality was in Immaterial and Missing Power, when she led Sakuya Izayoi out of the forest, who had become lost.",
        "Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu (四季映姫・ヤマザナドゥ Shiki Eiki Yamazanadu, given name \"Eiki\", surname \"Shiki\") is one of the Yama who judge the dead and decide whether they go to Heaven, Hell, the Netherworld, or get reincarnated. She currently resides in Hell. Whether it's because she simply has a habit of lecturing or because she genuinely wants others to change for the better, she's become well known in Gensokyo for lecturing anyone and everyone about their faults. The souls of the dead are brought to her by Komachi Onozuka, who ferries them over the Sanzu River to Higan. However, not every soul makes it all the way across without being tired out from the journey or being extinguished by Komachi.\n"+
                "As the Yama who judges people after they die, Eiki is impartial to anyone when lecturing them, whenever they are human or youkai. Since she is very preachy and is never mistaken about anything, this makes her hard to approach. Despite her stern attitude and seriousness at her job, Eiki has a teasing side, smiling even when revealing the shortcomings of the people she's lecturing. She's described as being polite and patient when lecturing.",
        "Eirin Yagokoro (八意　永琳 Yagokoro Eirin) is one of the antagonists of Imperishable Night. She's a medical genius from the Moon, able to create even the Hourai Elixir with the help of Kaguya's power, the manipulation of eternity. She is living in exile in Gensokyo after choosing to stay with and devote herself to Kaguya Houraisan on Earth rather than take her back to the Moon. She was a very well-known figure on the Moon, having not only been instrumental in the founding of Lunar society with Lord Tsukuyomi, but also being its leading medical mind and the person in charge of the Moon's emissaries to the Earth.\n" +
                "Eirin is an enigmatic person surrounded by many mysteries and her answers regarding the mysteries about her are incoherent replies. She is generally a fairly pleasant person and is devoted to serving her ally, Kaguya, but she does not suffer fools gladly, and because of her incredibly high intelligence, she can come across as conceited, impatient and condescending at times to those not sharp enough to follow her explanations immediately. However, she also seems to lack general common sense, most likely due to her not living with humans.",
        "Flandre Scarlet (フランドール・スカーレット Furandooru Sukaaretto) is the younger sister of Remilia Scarlet and a vampire who lives at the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She first appeared as the Extra stage boss of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and has appeared as a playable protagonist in Touhou Gouyoku Ibun.\n" +
                "she is described as being quite strange and eccentric, which makes it difficult for others to understand her.[1] She's also described as being \"normally docile\" and generally pleasant to be around, but somewhat of a loose cannon if left unwatched. In Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, it's suggested that she isn't very good at talking to other people, though she can get rather sassy and uppity when talking with her sister. Her friendship toward humans is very low.",
        "Hina Kagiyama (鍵山　雛 Kagiyama Hina) is a misfortune god and the leader of the Nagashi-bina doll army. Her job is to gather the misfortune of humans, as well as scare off lost humans who get too near to the Youkai Mountain at the Great Youkai Forest.\n" +
                "Hina's personality is unclear, but according to those who have come in contact with her, she appears to be friendly and sociable.",
        "Yuugi Hoshiguma (星熊 勇儀 Hoshiguma Yuugi) is an oni currently living in the Ancient City, which is in the Underworld. She has an unexplainable ability. She was once one of the Big Four of the Mountain, along with Suika Ibuki, and she lives alongside many other oni that were forced below ground.\n" +
                "Yuugi is a very firm and straightforward oni. She likes those who are strong and brave, and has no mercy for the weak and cowardly.",
        "Kanako Yasaka (八坂　神奈子 Yasaka Kanako) is the main antagonist of Mountain of Faith. She's the current goddess of the Moriya Shrine after defeating its previous resident goddess Suwako Moriya in the Great Suwa War. She desires to collect large amounts of faith, but since the humans of the Outside World no longer place much importance on gods, she has transported the shrine to Gensokyo. She currently lives on top of the Youkai Mountain, where she has an uneasy relationship with the leaders of the tengu.\n" +
                "Kanako is an ambitious woman who treats religion like a business, using whatever means bring her the most \"profit\" - that profit being instead faith. She has a natural presence that can seem intimidating or suspicious at times, but also reliable. Unusually for a god she has little respect for tradition - she demands little formality in her worship, and encourages scientific progress. It is somewhat strange for a deity to be knowledgeable and interested about science.",
        "Koishi's personality is generally playful and free-spirited, not unlike a child. While her ability to manipulate the unconscious makes her presence unsettling to many people, she seems overall less concerned with appearing or being scary, and more to do with whatever feels right in the moment. She does not seem to go out of her way to harm others out of malice or spite, although she has occasionally caused issues for other characters due to a lack of self-awareness, such as in her accidentally stealing Hata no Kokoro's mask in Hopeless Masquerade, or Sumireko Usami's smartphone in Urban Legend in Limbo.\n" +
                "In Urban Legend in Limbo, she takes on the urban legend of Mary-san,[1] a legend similar to the western Bloody Mary myth. Rather than wanting to be truly menacing, however, Koishi appeared to \"join in on the fun\" with the other characters also performing urban legends, eventually having to receive advice from Marisa Kirisame on how to make her urban legend scarier. She seems genuinely happy that she was able to use her urban legend effectively, even if it was only on a single person.",
        "Satori Komeiji (古明地　さとり Komeiji Satori) is the Mistress of the Palace of the Earth Spirits after the underground city was separated from Hell. Her ability to read minds causes various youkai and spirits to fear her, but makes her loved by the animals that normally can't be understood. With these animals as pets, she manages the ruins of the Hell of Blazing Fires where her home stands. She is also the main protagonist of Foul Detective Satori.\n" +
                "Not much is known about Satori's actual personality. When the heroine arrives at the Palace during the events of Subterranean Animism, she is very suspicious, and decides to fight against her by using danmaku patterns in the heroine's own mind (or that of her partner). However, she appears to be loved by animals, as they can't normally be understood in the first place.",
        "Letty Whiterock (レティ・ホワイトロック Reti Howaitorokku) is a seasonal youkai who's only seen during winter. She seems fittingly cold towards most of the humans she meets, and is feared by humans as she is known to freeze them.\n" +
                "She possesses an ability to manipulate chill. It's not an ability to create blizzards or make snow fall, but rather an ability to strengthen the \"winter\" that exists in the natural world. According to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, since this is equivalent to an ability that manipulates the winter within nature, she possesses tremendous power according to the environment, but she is pretty much powerless outside of winter. In Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, Letty herself said that outside of winter, she hides away in a place where not a ray of sunlight can reach. In Forbidden Scrollery, she is shown spreading snow over Gensokyo.",
        "Patchouli Knowledge (パチュリー・ノーレッジ Pachurii Noorejji) is a witch and resident of the Scarlet Devil Mansion in the library. She's friends with the mistress of the house, Remilia Scarlet, and acts as resident librarian. She's known as a highly capable, experienced, and studious magician, usually found researching the countless tomes within the house library. But her great abilities are offset by her poor health, caused by long-time reclusivity and asthma.\n" +
                "She doesn't have a very proactive personality, but rather always walks her own path. However, she's always interested where knowledge is concerned and will proactively go and try to acquire it. She does everything by the book, but still makes a lot of mistakes. She's also described as very dark and taciturn, which in this case means she is introverted and silent in expression and manner.",
        "Rin Kaenbyou (火焔猫 燐 Kaenbyou Rin) is one of Satori Komeiji's pets. Her job is to carry corpses to the former Hell of Blazing Fires to regulate its heat.\n" +
                "Rin has an energetic, positive personality; she prefers to be called Orin, since she doesn't like long names. She claims that while it is more fun to take on a pure cat form, she can't talk to humans that way - nor does it seem she can do her job, carting corpses away, which she seems to take great pleasure in. She appears to have challenged the main character in Subterranean Animism partly because she wanted their corpse, but also partly to test their strength to see if they would be able to stop Utsuho Reiuji for her, and appears to bear no ill will towards them for her defeat. Symposium of Post-mysticism states that she has no interest in killing humans herself to gain their corpses; she prefers to hunt for those on the verge of death, supposedly because it makes for more interesting conversation. If a corpse is properly buried, she'll lose interest.",
        "Seiga is a rather prideful girl who thinks Taoism is superior to other religions and tries to get people to convert. She acts to further her own goals, and nothing more, which is why she is labeled a wicked hermit and not accepted by the heavens. She doesn't seem to care about anyone, instead manipulating them for her own ends. Her revival of Yoshika's corpse shows her lack of regard for human rights. She doesn't appear interested in material possessions at all, despite her ability to pass through walls. However, in Symposium of Post-mysticism, she does take on a role of reverse-Santa Claus and steals people's belongings to sell back to whoever they bought it from.\n" +
                "She dislikes Byakuren Hijiri and eagerly awaits Toyosatomimi no Miko's revival. She is, however, very fond and proud of Yoshika Miyako and treats her more as a pet than a normal servant. She is someone who follows those she likes, but feels no particularly obligation to such people, making her alliance with Miko less assured than the other Taoists.",
        "Shizuha Aki (秋 静葉 Aki Shizuha) is the goddess of autumn leaves and thus has the power to control the turning of the leaves. She is Minoriko Aki's older sister and together they have the ability to control autumn.\n" +
                "She believes that the autumn colors of the turning leaves are the best thing about autumn, and is filled with a sense of superiority when she shows the beauty of the leaves to her sister. She becomes sorrowful and pessimistic as winter approaches.",
        "Suika Ibuki (伊吹 萃香 Ibuki Suika) is the main antagonist of Immaterial and Missing Power. She's a typical oni that loves drinking and fighting. Just as the folktales say, she has two horns on her head that symbolize her oni heritage, and enough physical strength to throw large boulders single-handedly.\n" +
                "Her personality is jolly and quite childish, as you would expect from her appearance. Despite her childlike exterior, however, she possesses great amounts of raw power. She loves drinking and is frequently seen in the fighting games drunk; she claims she's been drinking sake for some hundreds of years now.",
        "Suwako Moriya (洩矢　諏訪子 Moriya Suwako) is the original god of the Moriya Shrine. Officially the shrine now belongs to Kanako Yasaka, but in Suwako's words she handles most of the divine services while Kanako handles the \"sales\".\n" +
                "In contrast to Kanako, Suwako is more laid back and mischievous. She enjoys competing against others, and loses gracefully. Though she feigns ignorance, Suwako is just as capable of scheming as Kanako. Combined with her rarely leaving the shrine, her intentions can be hard to read.",
        "Tenshi Hinanawi (比那名居　天子 Hinanawi Tenshi) is the main antagonist of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody. She's the \"Eldest Daughter\" (総領娘 souryou musume) of the Hinanawi clan, as referred to by Iku Nagae, that resides in Heaven. Being in heaven, she has a rather carefree life which she considers boring.\n" +
                "In her official profile, Tenshi is described as being \"sheltered upbringing\", selfish and top of the world. Despite being a celestial, she is very earthly and lacks charisma. That's not surprising, however, because she became a celestial only because the entire Hinanawi family became celestials when the Nawi became divine spirits. Therefore, she lacks awareness of what it means to be a celestial.",
        "Tewi Inaba (因幡　てゐ Inaba Tewi) is the leader of the many youkai rabbits that live at and guard Eientei. She is also considered to be the leader of all the earth rabbits; it's said that there is not a single youkai rabbit unknown to her, and that all of them will only ever listen to her.[1] Despite her childish appearance, she is very old (at least 3,000 years old). If she really was the White Rabbit of Inaba, then this would make her one of the oldest characters in the Touhou Project.\n" +
                "Tewi is described as being more like a fairy than youkai, with being childish in her way of speaking and acting; specially with Reisen, who is the target of her pranks and she hides from the moon rabbit to annoy her. However, it's remarkable how Reisen said that the youkai rabbits only follow her [2], which indicates that she has a clear ability of leadership. Furthermore, she is charge of the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, and Eirin, Kaguya and Reisen can live in Eientei with her permission in exchange of \"lending their knowledge on the rabbits\" [2] and, as part of the forest, she will defend the mansion, which indicates how clever and loyal she can be. It's also important to remark how she though of selling her own species to humans to help and save them from being abandoned and living poorly as youkais [3], an idea that proves how she wishes the best for her people.",
        "Utsuho Reiuji (霊烏路 空 Reiuji Utsuho) is the main antagonist of Subterranean Animism. She's one of Satori Komeiji's pets and a Hell raven who has lived in the underground world since before it was separated from Hell. Her job is to regulate the flames of the Hell of Blazing Fires.\n" +
                "Utsuho has a simple and direct personality, it can even be said that she's airheaded. [1] . In fact, she misunderstood what Kanako Yasaka told her (\"We can use that to bring about the wishes of not just the underground, but the above ground as well.\") and believed that she had to use her new power to take over Gensokyo. Furthermore, when Sanae Kochiya told her that she is the shrine maiden that serves Kanako, Utsuho said she doesn't know that it's her; and after fighting, Utsuho didn't even remember the purpose of the fight and believes Sanae when she said that Utsuho was following Sanae's orders.",
        "Yuuka Kazami (風見　幽香 Kazami Yuuka) is a long-lived youkai called the \"Flower Master of the Four Seasons\" whose main place of activity is the Garden of the Sun, a field completely covered in sunflowers. She loves seasonal flowers, so throughout the year she moves to the respective places where the flowers grow: spring flowers for spring, summer flowers for summer, autumn flowers for autumn and sometimes winter flowers for winter.\n" +
                "Yuuka is a troublesome and playful youkai. She holds strength in high regard and likes to look down on and toy with those weaker than her. She's sharp-witted and thoroughly enjoys rubbing people the wrong way through various methods, ranging from simply joking around with her opponent[3] to (falsely) claiming credit for causing an incident[4]. Her Perfect Memento in Strict Sense article states her threat level as \"very high\" and her human friendship level as the \"worst\". However, she also tends to visit the Human Village and comes off as fairly polite, in addition to often appearing at the Hakurei Shrine on peaceful terms (like in her Phantasmagoria of Flower View ending, for example), meaning this could possibly be an exaggeration.",
        "She is very cheerful and friendly. In fact, her playful, good-humored personality, otherworldly beauty, and courtesan charm can have a disarming effect. She often makes bizarre and apparently nonsensical remarks and sometimes seems to overlook the obvious, leading to her characterization as an airhead or a ditz. For instance, in Touhou Bougetsushou, she toyed with Youmu Konpaku as a daily occurrence even with Ran Yakumo present.\n" +
                "However, at other times she will reveal an extremely cunning and perceptive side and will also sometimes display an extraordinary level of knowledge. For instance, in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she was the quickest character to identify the culprit as Tenshi Hinanawi when the incident was in the omen stage (Yukari Yakumo spoke of the dwindling of phantoms as Komachi Onozuka's negligence, but Yuyuko guessed correctly). Additionally, in Ten Desires, she obliquely informed the playable character about the location of the incident regarding the divine spirits. She is also known for her incredible appetite."
